# HCDE 310-project

This project is a mash-up of 3 APIs to create a data aggregate that can be 
useful for inland fishermen in the State of Washington. It provides stream water data, 
3-day weather forecast and observed fish species in the search radius.

APIs used: 

USGS Water Services Daily Values API https://waterservices.usgs.gov/docs/dv-service/daily-values-service-details/

NOAA Weather API https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api

WDFW Integrated Fish Distribution API https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/wdfw::statewide-washington-integrated-fish-distribution/about

Additional assistance for this project can be accredited to https://www.w3schools.com/ and Microsoft Copilot to develop the code
needed to make this project work.
